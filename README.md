Here you can find the fortran code "npztemp.F90" used in the paper "Resource limitation determines temperature response of unicellular plankton communities" by Camila Serra-Pompei, Andr√© W. Visser, and Ken H. Andersen (2019).

The code was done to fit the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) platform, which coupled this biological model to the  General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM).
